# tree-sitter-just

Tree-sitter grammar for Justfiles ([casey/just](https://github.com/casey/just))

To use treesitter based highlighting, folds etc. the queries need to be added
to the runtimepath, until I get a PR into `nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter`
you can install this repo as a plugin using Plug/packer/manual clone etc. This
plugin also adds a simple `ftdetect` plugin for detecting justfiles.

Packer:

```lua
use "IndianBoy42/tree-sitter-just"
```

Plug

```vimscript
Plug 'IndianBoy42/tree-sitter-just'
```

Manual

```
git clone https://github.com/IndianBoy42/tree-sitter-just \
  ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/tree-sitter-queries/start/tree-sitter-just
```

You can then do `require('tree-sitter-just').setup({})` to register the parser
with tree-sitter. You can then do `TSInstall`/`TSUpdate` as usual to install
the parser

You can also add the parser manually using (This is similar to what is done in
`require"tree-sitter-just".setup({})`)

```lua
require("nvim-treesitter.parsers").get_parser_configs().just = {
  install_info = {
    url = "https://github.com/IndianBoy42/tree-sitter-just", -- local path or git repo
    files = { "src/parser.c", "src/scanner.c" },
    branch = "main",
    -- use_makefile = true -- this may be necessary on MacOS (try if you see compiler errors)
  },
  maintainers = { "@IndianBoy42" },
}
```

Don't forget to `:TSInstall` after adding this. With this method you do not
have to add this repo as a plugin.

Please note that the nightly version of `nvim-treesitter`, at least since
`5b90ea2abaa4303b9205b5c9002a8cdd0acd11a5` (2024-01-19).

## Contributing

The easiest way to get started is, fittingly, with
[`just`](https://github.com/casey/just).

```sh
# Make sure dependencies are available
just setup

# Create autogenerated files and run tests
just test

# Create autogenerated files without testing
just gen

# Check linting rules
just lint

# Apply formatting
just fmt
```

Note that `just lint` and `just fmt` must pass for all changes. You can verify
these automatically before committing by running `just pre-commit-install`.

All our queries are in `queries-src`. This directory is what gets tested by
tree-sitter, and should be usable by helix. To generate queries for NeoVim,
run `./build-flavored-queries.py` (this is run as part of `npm run gen`).

You can use the [`:InspectTree`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/treesitter.html#%3AInspectTree)
command to explore the resulting parse tree, and
[`:Inspect`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua.html#%3AInspect) to view highlight
groups.

## Quirks of Just

Just currently doesn't seem to support comments between attributes or within if
statements, so we do not either.

```just
[private]
# hello!
[no-cd]
foo:
```

```just
foo := if true {
  # nope!
  "abcd"
}
```

## Test Information

The tests directory contains "corpus" tests that are checked for syntax, as
well as "highlight" tests that check the result. The "highlight" test directory
includes some test files generated by the fuzzer that aren't always human
readable.
