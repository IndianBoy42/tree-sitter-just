; ================ Global language specified ================
; Global language is set with something like one of the following:
;
;    set shell := ["bash", "-c", ...]
;    set shell := ["pwsh.exe"]
;
; We can extract the first item of the array, but we can't extract the language
; name from the string with something like regex. So instead we special case
; two things: powershell, which is likely to come with a `.exe` attachment that
; we need to strip, and everything else which hopefully has no extension. We
; separate this with a `#match?`.
;
; Unfortunately, there also isn't a way to allow arbitrary nesting or
; alternatively set "global" capture variables. So we can set this for item-
; level external commands, but not for e.g. external commands within an
; expression without getting _really_ annoying. Should at least look fine since
; they default to bash. Limitations...
; See https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/issues/880 for more on that.
